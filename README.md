🧠 Game Rules

- Two players take turns to roll a dice.
- On each roll:
  - If the number is **not 1**, it gets **added to the current score**.
  - If the number is **1**, the player **loses all current score**, and the **turn passes to the next player**.
- A player can **"Hold"** to add their current score to their total score and pass the turn.
- The first player to reach **100 points** wins the game.
